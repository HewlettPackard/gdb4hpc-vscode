## HPE Contribution Guide

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

This guide provides information on filing issues and guidelines for open source contributors. **Please leave comments / suggestions if you find something is missing or incorrect.**

Contributing
------------
You are invited to contribute new features, fixes, or updates, large or small; we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.

Before you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans with the targeted project/repo through a GitHub issue, especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.

* If you want to contribute design assets or style guide revisions, please open a GitHub pull request or open a GitHub issue against the particular project.
* If you want to raise an issue such as a defect or an enhancement request, please open a GitHub issue for the appropriate project. Please keep the following in mind:

    * Try to reduce your code to the bare minimum required to reproduce the issue.
    * If we can't reproduce the issue, we can't fix it. Please list the exact steps required to reproduce the issue.

## Issues

If you have suggestions for how this project could be improved, or want to report a bug, open an issue! We'd love all and any contributions. If you have questions, too, we'd love to hear them. 

It is a great way to contribute to gdb4hpc-vscode by reporting an issue. Well-written and complete bug reports are always welcome! Please open an issue on GitHub and follow the template to fill in required information.

Before opening any issue, please look up the existing [issues](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/gdb4hpc-vscode/issues) to avoid submitting a duplication.
If you find a match, you can "subscribe" to it to get notified on updates. If you have additional helpful information about the issue, please leave a comment.

When reporting issues include details but, because the issues are open to the public, when submitting the log and configuration files, be sure to remove any sensitive information, e.g. user name, password, IP address, and company name. You can replace those parts with "REDACTED" or other strings like "****".

Be sure to include the steps to reproduce the problem if applicable. It can help us understand and fix your issue faster.


Submitting Code Pull Requests
-----------------------------
We encourage and support contributions from the community. No fix is too small. We strive to process all pull requests as soon as possible and with constructive feedback. If your pull request is not accepted at first, please try again after addressing the feedback you received.

To make a pull request, you will need a GitHub account. For help, see GitHub's documentation on forking and pull requests.

All pull requests with code should include tests that validate your change.
